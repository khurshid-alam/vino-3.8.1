Subject: Reject new clients if in the deferred state

As mentioned in bug 641811, Vino can get stuck trying to process the
same data in an infinite loop if an authentication request is received
from a client while that client is in the deferred state.

Avoid this situation by closing new connections from the same client
when it is in the deferred state.
